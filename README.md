<h1 align="center">Hello there 👋🏿</h1>

<p>I am people-focused software developer who enjoys producing clean, test-driven code in a collaborative environment. I recently graduated from Makers Academy Bootcamp in London where I quickly learnt engineering best practices, tools and methodologies. I also have a Chemical Engineering BEng from the University of Birimingham with a background in Recruitment and E-commerce.</p>

<p>Fun fact: I had the opportunity to jump in and swim with a pod of wild dolphins at sea...I got scared and stayed on the boat  🚣🏿‍♀️</p>
