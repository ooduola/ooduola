<h1 align="center">Hello there 👋🏿</h1>

<p>I am people-focused software developer who enjoys producing clean, test-driven code in a collaborative environment building products people want. I recently graduated from Makers Academy Bootcamp in London where I quickly learnt engineering best practices, tools and methodologies. I also have a Chemical Engineering BEng from the University of Birimingham. </p>
