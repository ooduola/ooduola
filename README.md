<h1 align="center">Hello there 👋🏿</h1>

<p>I've been coding for a little over 5 months now and I recently graduated from Makers Academy Bootcamp in London. I also have a Chemical Engineering BEng from the University of Birimingham. I am people-focused software developer who enjoys producing clean, test-driven code in a collaborative environment, to build products people want.</p>
